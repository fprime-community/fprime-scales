# components::JetsonPowerStateManager

Controls configuration, enabling state transitions and power cycle operations

## Usage Examples
The JetsonPowerStateManager component is used to control the power states of the Jetson device. It provides capabilities to turn the Jetson on/off using GPIO, set different power states (15W, 30W, 50W) by writing to a text file, and monitor the Jetson's status through ping mechanisms.

### Typical Usage
1. The component is initialized with default power state configurations
2. The component can turn the Jetson on/off via GPIO signals
3. Power states can be changed (15W, 30W, 50W) by writing to a configuration text file on the Jetson
4. When the Jetson is awake, a ping is sent every 60 seconds to verify connectivity
5. The component monitors the Jetson's responsiveness and reports status through events and telemetry

## Port Descriptions
| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| pingReceive | Port for receiving ping requests to check if Jetson is awake |
| pingSend | Port for sending ping responses |
| powerStateReceive | Port for receiving power state change requests (e.g., 15W, 30W, 50W) |
| powerStateSend | Port for sending current power state information |
| schedIn | Port that receives the rate group "tick" for ping intervals |

## Component States
| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| PowerLevel.WATTS_15 | Jetson is in 15W power state |
| PowerLevel.WATTS_30 | Jetson is in 30W power state |
| PowerLevel.WATTS_50 | Jetson is in 50W power state |
| PowerLevel.UNKNOWN | Jetson power state is unknown or indeterminate |
